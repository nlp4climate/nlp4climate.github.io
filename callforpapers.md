<h2>Scope</h2>

This workshop is dedicated to how Natural Language Processing can be incorporated in climate change science and climate change action, for example how NLP can help mitigate or adapt to or help track climate change.

The importance of addressing climate change has been fully adopted by the scientific community. Moreover, policymakers, regulators and the economy start to catch up. Climate change leads to global, national, and local discussions, spanning various platforms and involving all sectors of society. However, there is only limited yet growing amounts of work at the intersection of climate change and NLP methods. This workshop's objective is to provide a platform for researchers and practitioners (and policymakers and other stakeholders) interested in contributing to the intersection of NLP and climate change. The workshop aims to fill the gap in the existing literature and shed light on the unique challenges, opportunities, and potential methods for applying NLP techniques in helping to combat climate change -- and explore other potential applications in this domain.

NLP has the potential to support faster and scaleable climate mitigation and adaptation action considerably. To explore specific use cases and the most promising approaches in the intersection of NLP and climate change, ClimateNLP will collect insights gained so far, outline potential avenues for future research, and discuss challenges with domain experts from Academia, NGOs, and Industry. A core goal of the workshop is to bring together a diverse set of stakeholders from Academia, NGOs, and Industry. Also, we try to understand each others' needs, and want to foster a discussion about the current state of this intersection and where this should be going in the future.
