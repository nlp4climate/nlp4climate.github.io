<h2>Scope</h2>

This workshop series is dedicated to exploring the intersection of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and climate change. The workshop aims to discuss how NLP methods can be incorporated in climate change science and climate change action.
The importance of addressing climate change has been fully adopted by the scientific community. Climate change is reflected in global, national, and local political discussions, corporate reporting, and all sectors of society â€“ resulting in vast amounts of textual data. Despite all that data and potential applications to help mitigate and adapt to climate change, we believe NLP methods to tackle climate change are under-developed. Therefore, the objective of this workshop series is to provide a platform for researchers and practitioners (as well as policymakers and other stakeholders) keen on contributing to the intersection of NLP and climate change.
The workshop series aims to shed light on these unique challenges and opportunities for applying NLP techniques to combat climate change. We believe NLP has the potential to support climate mitigation and adaptation action in a way that is considerably faster and more scalable, and ClimateNLP provides a platform to foster discussions about NLP applications in this domain.
