<h3 style='margin-bottom: 10pt;'>Description</h3>

<p>In the past few decades, the importance of addressing climate change has been fully adopted by the scientific community. At the same time, most policymakers and regulators around the world and the economy start to catch up. Climate change leads to global, national, and local discussions, spanning various platforms and involving all sectors of society. However, there is only limited yet growing amounts of work at the intersection of climate change and NLP methods. This workshop's primary objective is to provide a platform for researchers and practitioners (and policymakers and other stakeholders) interested in contributing to the intersection of NLP and climate change. The workshop aims to fill the gap in the existing literature and shed light on the unique challenges, opportunities, and potential methods for applying NLP techniques in helping to combat climate change -- and explore other potential applications in this domain.</p>

<p>The workshop's primary objective is to provide a platform for researchers, practitioners, policymakers, and other stakeholders interested in addressing the challenges of climate change and sustainable finance risks with the help of NLP applications. The workshop aims to fill the gap in the existing literature and shed light on the unique challenges, opportunities, and potential solutions for applying NLP techniques to address climate and sustainability risks for sustainable finance, sustainable economies, and climate policies. The workshop covers various topics. Amongst others, a focus will be on NLP-based information extraction from written reports and documents of various sources, using large language models for analyzing legal, policy, and corporate documents and extracting relevant information to identify patterns, trends, and strategies, supporting for example, the mapping and characterization of the world’s most polluting assets. 
</p>

<p>
We are very open to various sorts of submissions at the intersection of Climate Change and NLP. Some specific topics we will include in our call are detection and analysis of Environmental Claims; QA-systems for Climate Change related Information; Long Document Analysis; Stance Detection; climate change denial classification; Narratives around Climate Change; Automated Fact Checking of climate change related claims, and named entity mapping to asset-level data for spatial finance.
</p>

<p>
Some more broad topics include using machine translation for translating policies or any information related to climate to underrepresented languages to inform local communities better; Analysis of sentiment and specificity of corporate activities related to climate change; Knowledge integration in assets localization models; studies which involve climate risk, spatial finance, sustainable finance, and NLP; identification of greenwashing indicators identified through NLP methods; and automated assessment of physical or financial damage due to natural calamities using, e.g., news data or government sources. Furthermore, we are also interested in position and overview papers, new datasets, and new methods on existing training and benchmarking datasets. Lastly, we encourage the dialogue and submissions for climate-aware NLP and energy-efficient models.
</p>

<p>
A core goal of the goals of the workshop is to bring together people from Academia, NGOs, and Industry. Thus, we welcome contributions from NGOs and industry -- and also contributions showcasing work in which NLP methods could assist.
</p>

<p>To support this field of research, we are interested in fostering the discussion around:</p>
<ul>
	<li> methods that can effectively link language to actions and observations in the environment [10; 11; 12; 13; 14; 15; 16; 17; 18];</li>
	<li> research into language roles beyond encoding goal states, such as structuring hierarchical policies [19; 20; 21; 22], communicating domain knowledge [23; 24] or reward shaping [25; 26, 27]; </li>
	<li> methods that can help identify and incorporate outside textual information about the task, or general-purpose semantics learned from outside corpora [28; 29; 30];</li>
	<li> novel environments and benchmarks enabling such research and approaching complexity of real-world problem settings [31; 32; 33; 34; 35; 36].</li>
</ul>
<p>
The aim of the workshop on Language in Reinforcement Learning is to steer discussion and research of these problems by bringing together researchers from several communities, including reinforcement learning, robotics, natural language processing, computer vision and cognitive psychology. 
Since the last edition of LaReL at ICML 2020 [45; 46], we have seen a wealth of papers leveraging language to support or enhance cognitive functions in artificial agents: systematic generalization [37; 17], relational and causal learning [38], abstraction and planning [39; 40; 41] or goal imagination [42]. These results revive the old debate on the cognitive functions of language [43; 44] and let us foresee new ways for language to support artificial agents’ cognitive abilities beyond goal and reward specification [52]. We have also seen more work on transfer of commonsense knowledge from pretrained large language models (LLMs) [47; 48] beyond linguistic tasks to sequential decision making settings. Recent work has shown how LLMs can be used as planners [39; 49; 50], enabling learning in sparse data settings and to assist out of distribution generalization to novel tasks.</p>

<p>In the wake of tremendous progress on multimodal models, NLP, and RL, in this workshop we will try to take a step back and focus discussion on upcoming challenges in integrating language and sequential decision-making. We will prepare some hot questions as well as collect community-contributed questions through our website and social media; we will then focus the panel discussion on some of these questions as well as host an open breakout rooms session where all attendants can contribute to the discussion around those open problems.<p>

Some example questions:
<ul>
<li>How can NLP help address Climate Change</li>
<li>How can we update a language model to be helpful in this ocntext ?</li>
</ul>
