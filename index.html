<ul>
<li> <b>Q: Who is this workshop for?</b> A: We invite everybody who's interersted at the intersection of NLP and Climate Change and participates at ACL. We expect this to grow a lot, yet we all don't know yet what this intersection should look like exactly. This workshop wants to shed light on this :)</li>
<li><b>Q: What are the objectives of the workshop?</b> To discuss and learn more about Climate Change and NLP. To learn about objectives and goals of Climate Change science. To get to know various interdisciplinary stakeholders such as climate scientists, NGOs, NPOs, policy makers and regulators and to understand their perspective. To foster future collaborations. ?</li>
<li><b>Q: I am an NLP person and want to participate/help, what can I do?</b> Various options: We welcome you to submit a paper, CFP will follow in January. We are always looking for PC members to review papers. We appreciate any input regarding the setup of the workshop, and what you'd like to see -- please get in touch!</li>
<li><b>Q: I am a non-NLP person and want to participate/help, what can I do?</b> Various options: We welcome you to submit a paper / abstract, CFP will follow in January. If you want to present your perspective or have specific ideas what this workshop can do to help you achieve your goals -- let us know and get in touch! </li>

<h3 style='margin-bottom: 10pt;'>Description</h3>

<p>In the past few decades, the importance of addressing climate change has been fully adopted by the scientific community. At the same time, most policymakers and regulators around the world and the economy start to catch up. Climate change leads to global, national, and local discussions, spanning various platforms and involving all sectors of society. However, there is only limited yet growing amounts of work at the intersection of climate change and NLP methods [1]. This workshop's primary objective is to provide a platform for researchers and practitioners (and policymakers and other stakeholders) interested in contributing to the intersection of NLP and climate change. The workshop aims to fill the gap in the existing literature and shed light on the unique challenges, opportunities, and potential methods for applying NLP techniques in helping to combat climate change -- and explore other potential applications in this domain.</p>

<p> A core goal of the goals of the workshop is to bring together people from Academia, NGOs, and Industry. Thus, we welcome contributions from NGOs and industry -- and also contributions showcasing work in which NLP methods could assist.

<p>
We are very open to various sorts of submissions at the intersection of Climate Change and NLP. Some specific topics we will include in our call are detection and analysis of Environmental Claims; QA-systems for Climate Change related Information; Long Document Analysis; Stance Detection; climate change denial classification; Narratives around Climate Change; Automated Fact Checking of climate change related claims, and named entity mapping to asset-level data for spatial finance.
</p>

<p>
Some more broad topics include using machine translation for translating policies or any information related to climate to underrepresented languages to inform local communities better; Analysis of sentiment and specificity of corporate activities related to climate change; Knowledge integration in assets localization models; studies which involve climate risk, spatial finance, sustainable finance, and NLP; identification of greenwashing indicators identified through NLP methods; and automated assessment of physical or financial damage due to natural calamities using, e.g., news data or government sources. Furthermore, we are also interested in position and overview papers, new datasets, and new methods on existing training and benchmarking datasets. Lastly, we encourage the dialogue and submissions for climate-aware NLP and energy-efficient models.

<p>To support this field of research, we are interested in fostering the discussion around:</p>
<ul>
	<li> Analysis of sentiment and specificity of corporate activities related to climate change</li>
	<li> Identification of greenwashing indicators identified through NLP method</li>
	<li> Automated assessment of physical or financial damage due to natural calamities using, e.g., news data or government sources</li>
	<li> we encourage the dialogue and submissions for climate-aware NLP and energy-efficient models</li>
</ul>
<p>
NLP has the potential to support faster and scaleable climate mitigation and adaptation action considerably. To explore specific use cases and the most promising approaches in the intersection of NLP and climate change, We propose a workshop to collect insights gained so far, outline potential avenues for future research, and discuss challenges with domain experts from Academia, NGOs, and Industry.</p>

Some example questions:
<ul>
<li>How can NLP help address Climate Change</li>
<li>How can we update a language model to be helpful in this ocntext ?</li>
</ul>
