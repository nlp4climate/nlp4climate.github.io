<h1 style="text-align:center; margin-bottom:20pt; !important"> Submission Guide </h1>
To be announced. We expect this to be similar to all other ACL workshops.
<!--
Submission should be made on **OpenReview**.

Submissions should be anonymised papers up to 5 pages (appendices can be added to the main PDF); excluding references. Authors are encouraged to include a "Social Impacts Statement" that highlights "potential broader impact of their work, including its ethical aspects and future societal consequences". You must format your submission using the NeurIPS 2023 LaTeX style file or ICLR 2024 LaTeX style file. Reviews will be double-blind, with at least two reviewers assigned to each paper.

We welcome various types of papers including scientific papers, position papers, policy papers, and works in progress. Scientific papers must not have appeared at an archival venue before, however, non-scientific papers that have appeared in archival venues outside main machine learning venues are welcomed for submission.

All accepted papers will be available on the workshop website, but no formal workshop proceedings will be published.
