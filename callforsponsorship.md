We will host the second iteration of ClimateNLP at ACL 2025 in Vienna on July 31st or August 1st, after having organized ClimateNLP for the first time at ACL 2024 in Bangkok. The organizing committee includes researchers from Princeton University, Stanford University, Oxford University, ETH Zurich and the University of Zurich. To ensure the sustainability of ClimateNLP, we are seeking sponsorships for this and future workshops.

This workshop is dedicated to discuss how Natural Language Processing can be incorporated in Climate Change science, and help mitigating or adapting to climate change. The workshop's primary objective is to provide a platform for researchers and practitioners (and policymakers and other stakeholders) interested in contributing to the intersection of NLP and climate change. The workshop aims to fill the gap in the existing literature and shed light on the unique challenges, opportunities, and potential methods for applying NLP techniques in helping to combat climate change.

Sponsorships are available for any amount between : 2’000$ to 5’000$


<h2>Benefit for sponsors</h2>
<ul>
<li>Acknowledgement and logo placement on the conference website.</li>
<li>Mentioning sponsors in opening/closing remarks.</li>
<li>Featuring sponsor logos in promotional materials and slides.</li>
<li>Opportunities for sponsors to introduce their work</li>
</ul>

<h2>How we spend the money</h2>
<ul>
<li>We need sponsorships to reimburse conference fees and travel expenses for invited keynote speakers. We want to invite stakeholders from outside of Academia or core NLP which are unlikely to attend ACL anyways, and thus we need to cover their conference registration. This registration was 925$ at EMNLP 2024, a similar conference to ACL 2025. We also want to be able to reimburse additional travel expenses for our keynote speakers.</li>
<li>If there is still sponsorship money available after all these expenses, we would use them to reimburse travel of students attending the workshop in case their University does not cover that.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Unused money</h2>

Based on the success of previous editions, we anticipate ClimateNLP will continue in 2026. Any remaining sponsorship funds will be allocated to future ClimateNLP workshops or, if the event does not proceed, refunded to sponsors.

We will strickly stick to the [ACL's Sponsorshop Policy](https://2024.aclweb.org/assets/Sponsorship%20Brochure%20for%20ACL%202024%20Conferences%20-%202024-06-05.pdf) in all practices.
